    """Find new technosphere providers based on the location of the dataset.

    Designed to be used when the dataset's location changes, or when new datasets are added.

    Uses the name, reference product, and unit of the exchange to filter possible inputs. These must match exactly. Searches in the list of datasets ``data``.

    Will only search for providers contained within the location of ``ds``, unless ``contained`` is set to ``False``, all providers whose location intersects the location of ``ds`` will be used.

    A ``RoW`` provider will be added if there is a single topological face in the location of ``ds`` which isn't covered by the location of any providing activity.

    If no providers can be found, `relink_technosphere_exchanes` will try to add a `RoW` or `GLO` providers, in that order, if available. If there are still no valid providers, a ``InvalidLink`` exception is raised, unless ``drop_invalid`` is ``True``, in which case the exchange will be deleted.

    Allocation between providers is done using ``allocate_inputs``; results seem strange if ``contained=False``, as production volumes for large regions would be used as allocation factors.

    Input arguments:

        * ``ds``: The dataset whose technosphere exchanges will be modified.
        * ``data``: The list of datasets to search for technosphere product providers.
        * ``exclusive``: Bool, default is ``True``. Don't allow overlapping locations in input providers.
        * ``drop_invalid``: Bool, default is ``False``. Delete exchanges for which no valid provider is available.
        * ``biggest_first``: Bool, default is ``False``. Determines search order when selecting provider locations. Only relevant is ``exclusive`` is ``True``.
        * ``contained``: Bool, default is ``True``. If ture, only use providers whose location is completely within the ``ds`` location; otherwise use all intersecting locations.
